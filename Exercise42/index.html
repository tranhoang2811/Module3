                    <p>It's time for the annual <b>Messier Marathon</b>. 
                        Instead of lacing up their Nikes, amateur
                        astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night
                        vigil
                        hunting the Messier objects.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Messier objects</b> are stellar objects, classified by astronomer <b>Charles Messier</b> in
                        the
                        18th century, ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now is the only
                        time
                        of the year in which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see
                        all
                        of them, you have to start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise —
                        hence
                        the term, "marathon".
                    </p>
                    <p>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order
                        to
                        avoid seeing them. Messier was more interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful
                        stellar
                        objects kept getting in the way.
